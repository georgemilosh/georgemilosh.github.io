abstract = {We develop two artificial intelligence–based models (Models A and B) to predict time-evolving photospheric magnetic fields with an adjustable time step, ranging up to one solar rotation later. Model A predicts future magnetic field data using three consecutive radial magnetic field data sets, each 12 hr apart. Model B reconstructs evolving magnetic fields using two sets of three consecutive data sets, one from a given date and the other from 27 days later, each 12 hr apart. To train and evaluate our models, we use a Pix2PixCC-based architecture and radial magnetic field data sets from the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager during the solar maximum periods of 2012–2016 and 2021–2023. Models A and B successfully generate magnetic field data corresponding to the input prediction time step. Based on quantitative comparison, Model A outperforms the persistence model and performs comparably to the classical surface flux transport model. Model B shows improved performance compared to both models. We also compare predictions for National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Active Regions 12673 and 13664, which rapidly emerged and produced powerful solar flares. Notably, both Models A and B can predict increases in total unsigned magnetic fluxes several days in advance if their evolution is already captured in the input data. Model B also reconstructs radial magnetic fluxes that smoothly overlap between the input data and the model outputs. These results demonstrate the ability of our models to generate time-evolving magnetic field data flexibly and capture emerging magnetic fluxes, which are crucial for heliophysics research and space weather forecasting.}

      abstract={We present a data-driven emulator, a stochastic weather generator (SWG), suitable for estimating probabilities of prolonged heat waves in France and Scandinavia. This emulator is based on the method of analogs of circulation to which we add temperature and soil moisture as predictor fields. We train the emulator on an intermediate complexity climate model run and show that it is capable of predicting conditional probabilities (forecasting) of heat waves out of sample. Special attention is payed that this prediction is evaluated using a proper score appropriate for rare events. To accelerate the computation of analogs, dimensionality reduction techniques are applied and the performance is evaluated. The probabilistic prediction achieved with SWG is compared with the one achieved with a convolutional neural network (CNN). With the availability of hundreds of years of training data, CNNs perform better at the task of probabilistic prediction. In addition, we show that the SWG emulator trained on 80 years of data is capable of estimating extreme return times of order of thousands of years for heat waves longer than several days more precisely than the fit based on generalized extreme value distribution. Finally, the quality of its synthetic extreme teleconnection patterns obtained with SWG is studied. We showcase two examples of such synthetic teleconnection patterns for heat waves in France and Scandinavia that compare favorably to the very long climate model control run.},

abstract={Introduction: The goal of this study is to provide analysis of statistics and dynamics of extreme heatwaves over two areas of Europe, France and Scandinavia, while comparing and contrasting the representation in climate models and reanalysis.Methods: The 1000 year long datasets are generated using respectively two climate models of different complexity. The composite maps of the heatwaves found in these datasets are compared to the ones observed in reanalysis by estimating significance of such patterns. We also employ time series analysis, in particular compare return time plots and use Gaussian stochastic processes to model the temporal correlations for rare events.Results: Our investigation reveals that recurrent wavenumber three teleconnection patterns distinctly underpin heatwaves in France and Scandinavia. These patterns manifest in both surface temperature and mid-tropospheric geopotential height. For heatwaves of return times of 4 years such patterns are robustly represented across diverse models of complexity and reanalysis data. For longer return times, reanalysis records are too short to give statistically significant results, while models confirm the relevance of these large scale patterns for the most extreme heatwaves. Moreover, A time series analysis shows that heatwave indices defined at synoptic scale are fairly well described by Gaussian stochastic processes, and that these Gaussian processes reproduce well return time plots even for very rare events.Discussion: These results suggest that extreme heatwaves over different areas of Europe show recurrent typical behaviours in terms of long-range spatial correlations and subseasonal-scale temporal correlations. These properties are consistently represented among models of different complexity and observations, thus suggesting their relevance for a better understanding of the drivers and causes of the occurrence of extreme midlatitude heatwaves and their predictability.}

	abstract = {The Summer Olympic Games in 2024 will take place during the apex of the temperature seasonal cycle in the Paris Area. The mid-latitudes of the Northern hemisphere have witnessed a few intense heatwaves since the 2003 event. Those heatwaves have had environmental and health impacts, which often came as surprises. In this paper, we search for the most extreme heatwaves in Ile-de-France that are physically plausible, under climate change scenarios, for the decades around 2024. We circumvent the sampling limitation by applying a rare event algorithm on CMIP6 data to evaluate the range of such extremes. We find that the 2003 record can be exceeded by more than 4 $\,^{\circ}$C in Ile-de-France before 2050, with a combination of prevailing anticyclonic conditions and cut-off lows. This study intends to raise awareness of those unprecedented events, against which our societies are ill-prepared, in spite of adaptation measures designed from previous events. Those results could be extended to other areas of the world.},

  abstract={Understanding extreme events and their probability is key for the study of climate change impacts, risk assessment, adaptation, and the protection of living beings. Extreme heatwaves are, and likely will be in the future, among the deadliest weather events. Forecasting their occurrence probability a few days, weeks, or months in advance is a primary challenge for risk assessment and attribution but also for fundamental studies about processes, dataset and model validation, and climate change studies. In this work we develop a methodology to build forecasting models which are based on convolutional neural networks, trained on extremely long 8000-year climate model outputs. This approach is parallel to weather model forecasting and has complementary scopes. Because the relation between extreme events is intrinsically probabilistic, we emphasize probabilistic forecast and validation. We demonstrate that neural networks have positive predictive skills, with respect to random climatological forecasts, for the occurrence of long-lasting 14-day heatwaves over France, up to 15 days ahead of time for fast dynamical drivers (500 hPa geopotential height fields), and also at much longer lead times for slow physical drivers (soil moisture). This forecast is made seamlessly in time and space, for fast hemispheric and slow local drivers. The method is easily implemented and versatile. We find that the neural network selects extreme heatwaves associated with a north hemisphere wave-number 3 pattern. We argue that this machine learning approach should be key in the future for quantitative process studies, model intercomparisons, and dataset studies. For instance, we find that the 2 meter temperature field does not contain any new useful statistical information for heatwave forecast, when added to the 500 hPa geopotential height and soil moisture fields. The main scientific message is that most of the times, training neural networks for predicting extreme heatwaves occurs in a regime of lack of data. We suggest that this is likely to be the case for most other applications to large-scale atmosphere and climate phenomena. Depending on the information to be learned, training might require dataset lengths as long as several thousands of years, or even more, for optimal forecasting skill. For instance, using 100-year-long training sets, a regime of drastic lack of data, leads to severely lower predictive skills and general inability to extract useful information available in the 500 hPa geopotential height field at a hemispheric scale in contrast to the dataset of several thousand years long. Even with several-thousand-year-long datasets, no convergence is observed in the predictive skills coming from hemispheric geopotential height fields. We discuss perspectives for dealing with the lack of data regime, for instance, rare event simulations and how transfer learning may play a role in this latter task.},

  abstract={The main goal of this article is to explore the possible sources for large-scale coherent magnetic structures that can be created in turbulent electron-proton plasmas.
We work with the model developed for applications to solar wind, which is obtained
as a fluid closure of gyrokinetic equations that describe magnetized collisionless plasmas. It can be thought of as a generalisation of magnetohydrodynamics spaning the
scales above and below the ion Larmor radius (intermediate scale), which leads to
nonlinear dispersive phenomenology of interacting kinetic Alfvén waves (KAW). The
chief quantity of interest is Generalized Cross Helicity (GCH) which measures the
energy of imbalance between the two KAW eigenmodes. At large scales they merge
with Alfvén wave branches which propagate forward and backward relative to the
magnetic field line. It was known that at large scales the cascade is forward like in
usual Kolmogorov phenomenology and there were theoretical reasons to believe the
cascade reversed sign at small scales. Using 3D numerical simulations we have found
that the inverse cascade is suppressed at intermediate scales, which leads to the formation of large elongated magnetic vortices on the Larmor scale (termed finite-scale
condensate). This is interesting since it is perhaps related to the result by another
group (Meyrand at al 2021), whereby the forward cascade in the similar system was also suppressed at
the Larmor scale. This process can potentially explain ion-kinetic spectral breaks in
plasma turbulence, and provide theory alternative to that of, where the effects of
Landau damping were phenomenologically included.
Furthermore, we study the decay instability of KAW, i.e. the decay of a pump mode
into two daughter modes, one with larger wavenumber and one with smaller. This
is resonant behavior which is possible due to the dispersive nature of KAW. Related
to these events are instabilities of the balanced state (between the two KAW eigenmodes)},

  abstract={One of the challenges involved in modeling processes in collsionless plasmas is related to their multi-scale and multi-species nature. This motivates reductions, i.e.
approximations, which are sometimes performed in an uncontrolled way, without
maintaining conservation laws. We stipulate that the conservation laws such as energy and momentum and the associated symmetries actually play a crucial role in
physics. In this paper we perform a formal asymptotic expansion and introduce the
slow manifold on which the dynamics is constrained so that electromagnetic waves
are eliminated. In particular, having in mind elimination of fast modes (electromagnetic waves), expansion of Maxwell-Vlasov system is performed and a sequence of
reduced models are derived which include: Vlasov-Poisson and Vlasov-Darwin but
also the next order expansion, which couples the transverse electromagnetic field to
the Braginskii pressure tensor and the magnetic field to the charge-weighted heat
flux tensor. The latter effect has not been considered earlier to our knowledge. One
of the possible applications for this family of models is to avoid spurious radiation
noise in Particle-in-Cell codes, which are commonly used in plasma simulations. This
would thus require discretization techniques, which can be performed directly within
the Hamiltonian action principle formalism.
In the remainder of the paper (which is more interesting for mathematical physicists)
the heuristic time scale is derived on which the state prepared on the dark slow manifold remains asymptotically close to it. In the dimensionless units the expansion depends on the small parameter that is inversely proportional to speed of light. When
the former is set to zero Vlasov-Poisson model is recovered. Straightforward truncation of the Poisson bracket may not conserve the Jacobi identity, which is a crucial
ingredient for the Hamiltonian theory. Without it Darboux’s theorem is violated and
local canonical variables may not exist. Most fundamental physical models we are
aware of satisfy Jacobi identity. Thus alternative approach is undertaken, whereby
instead of truncating Poisson bracket, which has no geometric interpretation, we
truncate the conjugate two-form Ω. This approach can be thought of as an infinite
dimensional generalization of a Lie-transform. It is infinite dimensional because our
phase space is spanned by a group of transformations of the distribution function
f (similar to Euler-Lagrange maps) as well as 3-dimensional electric E and magnetic
fields B. In a nutshell, using language of differential forms we find a coordinate-free
transformation of variables that “rectifies” symplectic two-form Ω of the dark slow
manifold onto the one of the Vlasov-Poisson system. As a consequence, Hamiltonian
and the Poisson bracket are recovered in the new coordinates, so that the new Poisson bracket is actually equivalent to the more simple one given by Vlasov-Poisson.
The resulting equations of motion are also derived. The procedure ensures that the
approximations we made preserve the sought for Hamiltonian structure.},

Special attention is paid to the regime of imbalance between the energies of counter-propagating waves commonly observed in the solar wind (SW), especially in regions relatively close to the Sun. In the collisionless regime where dispersive effects arise at scales comparable to or larger than those where dissipation becomes effective, the imbalance produced by a given injection rate of generalized cross-helicity (GCH), which is an invariant, is much larger than in the corresponding collisional regime described by the usual (or reduced) magnetohydrodynamics. The combined effect of high imbalance and ion Landau damping induces a steep energy spectrum for the transverse magnetic field at sub-ion scales. This spectrum is consistent with observations in highly Alfvénic regions of the SW, such as trailing edges, but does not take the form of a transition range continued at smaller scales by a shallower spectrum. This suggests that the observed spectra displaying such a transition result from the superposition of contributions originating from various streams with different degrees of imbalance. Furthermore, when imbalanced energy injection is supplemented at small scales in an already fully developed turbulence, for example under the effect of magnetic reconnection, a significant enhancement of the imbalance at all scales is observed.},

With the first, the action is extremized under the constraints of density, entropy, and Lagrangian label conservation, which leads to a Clebsch representation for a generalized momentum and a generalized vector potential. The second action arises upon transformation to physical field variables, giving rise to a covariant bracket action principle, i.e., a variational principle in which constrained variations are generated by a degenerate Poisson bracket. Upon taking appropriate limits, the action principles lead to relativistic Hall MHD and well-known relativistic ideal MHD. For the first time, the Hamiltonian formulation of relativistic Hall MHD with electron thermal inertia (akin to Comisso et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 045001 (2014) for the electron–positron plasma) is introduced. This thermal inertia effect allows for violation of the frozen-in magnetic flux condition in marked contrast to nonrelativistic Hall MHD that does satisfy the frozen-in condition. We also find the violation of the frozen-in condition is accompanied by freezing-in of an alternative flux determined by a generalized vector potential. Finally, we derive a more general 3 + 1 Poisson bracket for nonrelativistic extended MHD, one that does not assume smallness of the electron ion mass ratio.},

	abstract = {Recent progress regarding the noncanonical Hamiltonian formulation of extended magnetohydrodynamics (XMHD), a model with Hall drift and electron inertia, is summarized. The advantages of the Hamiltonian approach are invoked to study some general properties of XMHD turbulence, and to compare them against their ideal MHD counterparts. For instance, the helicity flux transfer rates for XMHD are computed, and Liouville's theorem for this model is also verified. The latter is used, in conjunction with the absolute equilibrium states, to arrive at the spectra for the invariants, and to determine the direction of the cascades, e.g., generalizations of the well-known ideal MHD inverse cascade of magnetic helicity. After a similar analysis is conducted for XMHD by inspecting second order structure functions and absolute equilibrium states, a couple of interesting results emerge. When cross helicity is taken to be ignorable, the inverse cascade of injected magnetic helicity also occurs in the Hall MHD range—this is shown to be consistent with previous results in the literature. In contrast, in the inertial MHD range, viz at scales smaller than the electron skin depth, all spectral quantities are expected to undergo direct cascading. The consequences and relevance of our results in space and astrophysical plasmas are also briefly discussed.},

The generalized helicities, and other geometric expressions for these models are presented in a topological context, emphasizing their universal facets. Some of the results presented include: the generalized Kelvin circulation theorems; the existence of two Lie-dragged 2-forms; and two concomitant helicities that can be studied via the Jones polynomial, which is widely utilized in Chern–Simons theory. The ensuing commonality is traced to the existence of an underlying Hamiltonian structure for all the extended MHD models, exemplified by the presence of a unique noncanonical Poisson bracket, and its associated energy.},

	abstract = {Through the use of suitable variable transformations, the commonality of all extended magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) models is established. Remarkable correspondences between the Poisson brackets of inertialess Hall MHD and inertial MHD (which has electron inertia, but not the Hall drift) and extended MHD (which has both effects) are established. The helicities (two in all) for each of these models are obtained through these correspondences. The commonality of all the extended MHD models is traced to the existence of two Lie-dragged 2-forms, which are closely associated with the canonical momenta of the two underlying species. The Lie-dragging of these 2-forms by suitable velocities also leads to the correct equations of motion. The Hall MHD Poisson bracket is analyzed in detail, the Jacobi identity is verified through a detailed proof, and this proof ensures the Jacobi identity for the Poisson brackets of all the models.},

  abstract = {We study instabilities and relaxation to equilibrium in a long-range extension of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPU) oscillator chain by exciting initially the lowest Fourier mode. Localization in mode space is stronger for the long-range FPU model. This allows us to uncover the sporadic nature of instabilities, i.e., by varying initially the excitation amplitude of the lowest mode, which is the control parameter, instabilities occur in narrow amplitude intervals. Only for sufficiently large values of the amplitude, the system enters a permanently unstable regime. These findings also clarify the long-standing problem of the relaxation to equilibrium in the short-range FPU model. Because of the weaker localization in mode space of this latter model, the transfer of energy is retarded and relaxation occurs on a much longer timescale.},

	title = {Dipolar needles in the microcanonical ensemble: Evidence of spontaneous magnetization and ergodicity breaking},
	journal = {{EPL} (Europhysics Letters)},
	abstract = {A family of Ising models with long-range interactions was known to have gaps in
magnetization to which no microscopic configuration corresponds. Long range systems have many other interesting statistical physics phenomena, such as ensemble
inequivalence (canonical and microcanonical) and negative specific heat to name a
few. In this letter we studied a needle-like (long) lattices of dipolar spins and we
have shown that their Hamiltonian can be mapped to aforementioned long-range
Ising model using some heuristic arguments. As such it motivates this family of Ising
models and can be considered a more physical realization thereof. Such systems can
be motivated by the experiments with some rare-earth compounds and nanoparticle
essemblies. The mapping allows us to identify phase transitions in our samples of
dipolar needles with the ones of the Ising model. These phase transitions involve ferromagnetic, paramagnetic and meta-stable states which lead to telegraph noise-type
transitions between such states in the metastable region, that we observe with direct
numerical simulations. The precise onset of the phase transitions can be determined
from the control parameters such as the length of our samples as well as the type
of lattice we use (simple cubic, face centered, body centered). The results from numerical simulations are duly compared to analytical estimates with relatively good
agreement. The overall mechanism of the transitions between different states can
be motivated by anti-ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor and ferromagnetic mean-field
coupling. We believe that the result crucially depends on the long-range nature of the
spin interaction in our system. For this we have estimated the correlation length one
would expect from a short range system, which turns out to be roughly the size of
the lattice constant, thus clearly too small. This fact suggests that the magnetization
order we observe is not of a short-range character},

  abstract = {We consider a damped β-Fermi-Pasta-Ulam chain, driven at one boundary subjected to stochastic noise. It is shown that, for a fixed driving amplitude and frequency, increasing the noise intensity, the system’s energy resonantly responds to the modulating frequency of the forcing signal. Multiple peaks appear in the signal-to-noise ratio, signaling the phenomenon of stochastic resonance. The presence of multiple peaks is explained by the existence of many stable and metastable states that are found when solving this boundary value problem for a semicontinuum approximation of the model. Stochastic resonance is shown to be generated by transitions between these states.},
